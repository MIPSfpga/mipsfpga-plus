<p><big><b>2.  The theory of operation</b></big></p>

<p>Interrupt is one of the key concepts in computer programming and system
design.  Interrupt is basically a feature of a CPU that forces the processor
to suspend the regular flow of instruction execution and to jump to a
certain program address in response to some external event.  The external
event is usually a change in a hardware signal from outside of the CPU.  The
memory location (or, in some processors, an index in an array of memory
locations) where the processor jumps to, is called the interrupt vector. 
The piece of code where the control goes after landing on the interrupt
vector, is called the interrupt service routine, or ISR.  After the ISR is
executed, the control goes back to the program location that was executed by
the processor when it received the interrupt.</p>

<p>The external event that causes the interrupt can be a tick of a timer
clock.  Such timer interrupts are useful to organize task switching in a
system where several software tasks, or programs, share the same processor,
which switches between them.  Another example of an external event that
causes an interrupt is a signal about the completion of an input/output
operation.  Such I/O interrupts are useful to offload the regular program
flow from constant polling of I/O registers, checking their status, as shown
on <b><font color=blue>Figure 1</font></b>.</p>

<p>Interrupt, sometimes called more specifically hardware interrupt, is a
special case of a more general term "exception".  An exception is suspending
the regular instruction flow and jumping to a vector in response not only to
an external signal, but also to some internal conditions of the CPU, the
conditions that require immediate attention.  Such conditions include
errors: arithmetic overflows, accessing out of range address, running a
privileged instruction in non-privileged (user) mode, bus errors, and other
unusual conditions.  Some of those errors should terminate the offending
program, while others should cause the program to recover, though the action
of the exception service routine.  Some of those conditions, like memory
address exceptions, may be not considered errors at all, but parts of the
mechanics of virtual memory implementation.  There are also so-called
software interrupts, the exceptions that are intentionally caused by the
program to request the services of the operating system.  Exceptions are
also used in the processor's debug interface.  During this lab we will deal
strictly with "true" hardware interrupts.  To learn about the other aspects
of exceptions, please consult the core and architecture documentation.</p>

<p>Historically, the need for exceptions and interrupts was so obvious that
they appeared very early in the history of computers, as shown on <b><font

<p>According to the article <i>Interrupts</i> by Mark Smotherman (<a
href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/interrupts.html#dyseac">https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/interrupts.html#dyseac</a>),
the first computer that employed I/O interrupts was DYSEAC, the second
version of SEAC, the Standards Electronic Automatic Computer.  According to
Wikipedia (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DYSEAC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DYSEAC</a>),
"DYSEAC was a first-generation computer built by the National Bureau of
Standards for the US Army Signal Corps.  It went into operation in April
1954".  According to Smotherman, DYSEAC was perhaps also the first mobile
computer, carried in two tractor trailers at 12 and 8 tons, as shown on
