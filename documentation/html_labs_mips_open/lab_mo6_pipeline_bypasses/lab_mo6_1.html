<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>In this lab a student directly observes pipeline forwarding in action.
The pipeline forwarding, or bypassing, is one of the most important
microarchitectural tricks in CPU design.  During the lab, a student connects
bypass control signals of MIPSfpga CPU core to LED signals on FPGA board,
and watches with his eyes the pattern of flashing LEDs, when running
different assembly programs on the synthesized MIPSfpga system configured
inside the FPGA.  Obviously, in order to see anything meaningful with this
way of observation, the design uses a really slow clock, 0.75 Hz, less than
a beat per second.</p>

<p>The method used in this lab is not a substitute for traditional debug,
trace and performance measuring methods used to evaluate microarchitectural
features by an experienced CPU designer.  This lab is intended for a
beginning student who wants to visualize the work of the pipeline in a most
straightforward fashion, without using too much imagination.  The subsequent
labs in MIPSfpga package use more complicated and indirect, but more
generally applicable methods to explore the pipelining.</p>
