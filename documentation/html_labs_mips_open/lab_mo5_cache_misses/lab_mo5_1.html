<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>This lab demonstrates how the work of CPU cache can be directly observed
in the most obvious and straigtforward fashion when running MIPSfpga-based
system on FPGA board.  During this lab a student first makes the design
clock running really slow (a dozen of beats per second), and then the
student's program fills a two-dimensional memory array in one of two
different ways: either with moving row index first or with moving column
index first.  The resulting cache hit and miss patterns are clearly visible
on blinking LED, which is connected to a signal that indicates cache fill
line request.  The student can see that these patterns are different for
raw-first and column-first runs.</p>

<p>Each cache line in MIPSfpga CPU cache holds four 32-bit words.  As a
result, when the program fills the memory array by moving column index
first, the pattern is going to be "cache miss - hit - hit - hit - miss - hit
- hit - hit - miss ...".  However when the program fills the array by moving
raw index first, the pattern is going to be a series of cache misses
followed by a long series of cache hits, since a large portion of the array
is already in the cache.</p>

<p>This lab does not attempt to measure, quantify or analyze cache behavior
in details.  The only goal of this lab is to create "A-ha" moment for a
student who wants to visualize for himself the role a CPU cache plays in the
computer system.  The precise analysis requires using different methods, for
example performance counters, as described in other cache-related labs in
MIPSfpga 2.0 package.</p>
