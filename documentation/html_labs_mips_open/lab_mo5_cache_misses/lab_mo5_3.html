<p><big><b>3.  Lab steps</b></big></p>

<p>This section outlines the sequence of steps, necessary to complete the
lab.  Almost all generic steps in this lab are the same as in <i>MIPSfpga
2.0 Lab MO1.  Using MIPSfpga with Serial Loader Flow that does not require
BusBlaster board and OpenOCD software</i>.  Such generic steps are not
described in this section.  Only the steps different from <i>Lab MO1</i> are
explained in details.</p>

<p><big><b>3.1.  Connect the board to the computer</b></big></p>

<p>For <i>Digilent</i> boards, such as <i>Nexys4</i>, <i>Nexys4 DDR</i> or
<i>Basys3</i>, this step is obvious.  For <i>Altera/Terasic</i> boards some
additional steps required:</p>

<ol>

<li>Connect USB-to-UART connector to FPGA board.  Either <i>FT232RL</i> or
<i>PL2303TA</i> that you can by from AliExpress or RadioShack will do the
job.  <i>TX</i> output from the connector (green wire on <i>PL2303TA</i>)
should go to pin 3 from right bottom on Terasic DE0, DE0-CV, DE1, DE2-115
(right top on DE0-Nano) and <i>GND</i> output (black wire on
<i>PL2303TA</i>) should be connected to pin 6 from right bottom on Terasic
DE0, DE0-CV, DE1, DE2-115 (right top on DE0-Nano).  Please consult photo
picture in <i>Lab MO1</i> to avoid short-circuit or other connection
problems.</li>

<li>For <i>FT232RL</i> connector: make sure to set 3.3V/5V jumper on
<i>FT232RL</i> part to 3.3V.</li>

<li>For the boards that require external power in addition to the power that
comes from USB, connect the power supply.  The boards that require the extra
power supply include <i>Terasic DE2-115</i>.</li>

<li>Connect FPGA board to the computer using main connection cable provided
by the board manufacturers.  Make sure to put USB cable to the right jack
when ambiguity exists (such as in <i>Terasic DE2-115</i> board).</li>

<li>Make sure to power the FPGA board (turn on the power switch) before
connecting the UART cable from USB-to-UART connector to the computer. 
Failing to do so may result in electric damage to the board.</li>

<li>Connect USB-to-UART connector to FPGA board.</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>3.2.  Select the appropriate hardware system configuration for
the lab</b></big></p>

<p>Before running synthesis it is necessary to review and possibly modify
the file <i>system_rtl/mfp_ahb_lite_matrix_config.vh</i> that includes a set
of Verilog <i>`define</i> statements that determine the functionality of the
synthesized MIPSfpga system.  The configuration should be the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>File <i>system_rtl/mfp_ahb_lite_matrix_config.vh</i></p>
<pre>

//
//  Configuration parameters
//

// `define MFP_USE_WORD_MEMORY
// `define MFP_INITIALIZE_MEMORY_FROM_TXT_FILE
   `define MFP_USE_SLOW_CLOCK_AND_CLOCK_MUX
   `define MFP_USE_UART_PROGRAM_LOADER
// `define MFP_DEMO_LIGHT_SENSOR
   `define MFP_DEMO_CACHE_MISSES
// `define MFP_DEMO_PIPE_BYPASS

</pre></blockquote>

<p><big><b>3.3.  Run the synthesis and configure the FPGA with the
synthesized MIPSfpga system</b></big></p>

<p>This step is identical to the synthesis step in <i>Lab MO1</i></p>

<p><big><b>3.4.  Go to the lab directory and clean it up</b></big></p>

<p>Under Windows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
cd programs\05_cache_misses
00_clean_all.bat
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Under Linux:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
cd programs/05_cache_misses
./00_clean_all.sh
</pre></blockquote>

<p><big><b>3.5.  Review the lab program code</b></big></p>

<p>The main program is located in file <i>programs/05_cache_misses/main.c</i>.</p>

<p>The loop at the beginning (<i>"while ((MFP_SWITCHES & 4) == 0) ;"</i>) is
needed so that the program can start with high clock speed (25 MHz) and the
switch to very low clock speed (12.5 Hz) happens only after you first switch
the speed by turning on switch one and then let the program to continue by
turning on switch two.  For more details about the switchable clock see
<i>MIPSfpga 2.0 Lab MO2.  Using switchable clock to observe the CPU
cycle-by-cycle</i>.</p>

<p>The program has two variants - with uncommented <i>"a [i][j] = i +
j;"</i> and with uncommented <i>"a [j][i] = i + j;"</i>.  For the first run
make sure <i>"a [i][j] = i + j;"</i> is uncommented and <i>"a [j][i] = i +
j;"</i> is commented:</p>

<blockquote><p>File <i>programs/05_cache_misses/main.c</i></p>
<pre>

#include "mfp_memory_mapped_registers.h"

int a [8][8];

int main ()
{
    int n = 0;
    int i, j;

    // Wait for switch 2

    while ((MFP_SWITCHES & 4) == 0)
        ;


    for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i ++)
        for (j = 0; j &lt; 8; j ++)
               a [i][j] = i + j;
            // a [j][i] = i + j;

    return 0;
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p><big><b>3.6.  Prepare the first software run</b></big></p>

<p>Following the procedure described in <i>Lab MO1</i>, compile and link the
program, generate Motorola S-Record file and upload this file into the
memory of the synthesized MIPSfpga-based system on the board.</p>

<p>Under Windows:</p>

<ol>

<li>cd programs\05_cache_misses</li>

<li>run 02_compile_and_link.bat</li>

<li>run 08_generate_motorola_s_record_file.bat</li>

<li>run 11_check_which_com_port_is_used.bat</li>

<li>edit 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.bat based on the result from the
previous step - set the working port in "set a=" assignment.</li>

<li>Make sure the switches 0, 1, 2 on FPGA board are turned off.  Switches 0
and 1 control the speed of the clock, while switch 2 gates the program
execution - see <i>3.5.  Review the lab program code</i>.  If the switches 0
and 1 are not off, the loading through UART is not going to work; if the
switch 2 is not off, the program will execute before you have a chance to
change the clock speed.</li>

<li>run 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.bat</li>

</ol>

<p>Under Linux:</p>

<p>If uploading program to the board first time during the current Linux
session, add the current user to <i>dialout</i> Linux group. Enter the
<i>root</i> password when prompted:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sudo adduser $USER dialout
su - $USER
</pre></blockquote>

<p>After that:</p>

<ol>

<li>cd programs/05_cache_misses</li>

<li>run ./02_compile_and_link.sh</li>

<li>run ./08_generate_motorola_s_record_file.sh</li>

<li>run ./11_check_which_com_port_is_used.sh</li>

<li>edit ./12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.sh based on the result from the
previous step - set the working port in "set a=" assignment</li>

<li>Make sure the switches 0, 1, 2 on FPGA board are turned off.  Switches 0
and 1 control the speed of the clock, while switch 2 gates the program
execution - see <i>3.5.  Review the lab program code</i>.  If the switches 0
and 1 are not off, the loading through UART is not going to work; if the
switch 2 is not off, the program will execute before you have a chance to
change the clock speed.</li>

<li>./run 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.sh</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>3.7.  The first run</b></big></p>

<ol>

<li>Make sure the switches 0, 1, 2 on FPGA board are turned off.  Switches 0
and 1 control the speed of the clock, while switch 2 gates the program
execution - see <i>3.5.  Review the lab program code</i>.  If the switches 0
and 1 are not off, the boot sequence (a sequence of processor instructions
before <i>main</i> function) will take too long.  If the switch 2 is not
off, the program will execute before you have a chance to change the clock
speed.</li>

<li><p>Reset the processor.  The reset buttons for each board are listed
in the table below:</p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0 rules=all>
<tr>
<th>Board</th>
<th>Reset button</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>Digilent Basys3</td><td>Up</td></tr>
<tr><td>Digilent Nexys4</td><td>Dedicated CPU Reset</td></tr>
<tr><td>Digilent Nexys4 DDR</td><td>Dedicated CPU Reset</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE0</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE0-CV</td><td>Dedicated reset button</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE0-Nano</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE1</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE2-115</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE10-Lite</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
</table>

</li>

<li>Turn the switch 1 on.  This will switch the system clock from 25 MHz to
12.5 Hz.  You should see LED 7 start blinking, it is connected straight to
the system clock.</li>

<li><p>Now turn your attention to LED 6, next right from blinking LED 7. LED
6 is connected to the signal that signifies cache fill burst.</p>

<blockquote><p>File <i>system_rtl/mfp_ahb_lite_matrix.v</i></p>
<pre>

    `ifdef MFP_DEMO_CACHE_MISSES

    wire burst = HTRANS == `HTRANS_NONSEQ && HBURST == `HBURST_WRAP4;

    assign IO_GreenLEDs = { { `MFP_N_GREEN_LEDS - (1 + 1 + 6) { 1'b0 } },
                            HCLK, burst, HADDR [7:2] };

    `endif

</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>Turn the switch 2 on.  It will let the program to proceed to fill the
array.  Continue watching LED 6.</li>

<li>LED 6 starts blinking.  The first couple of requests are coming from
instruction fetches filling L1 instruction cache, not L1 data cache, but
after this you can see blinks with the frequency of cache fills.</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>3.8.  The second run</b></big></p>

<p>Turn all switches to off position and go back to the program code. 
Comment out <i>"a [i][j] = i + j;"</i> and uncomment <i>"a [j][i] = i +
j;"</i>.  Now we are going to fill the array by rows, not by columns.</p>

<blockquote><p>File <i>programs/05_cache_misses/main.c</i></p>
<pre>

#include "mfp_memory_mapped_registers.h"

int a [8][8];

int main ()
{
    int n = 0;
    int i, j;

    // Wait for switch 2

    while ((MFP_SWITCHES & 4) == 0)
        ;


    for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i ++)
        for (j = 0; j &lt; 8; j ++)
            // a [i][j] = i + j;
               a [j][i] = i + j;

    return 0;
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>Repeat the compile, link and other steps as described in sections 3.6 and
3.7.  You should see a different memory access pattern as manifested on LED
6.  Instead of "cache miss - hit - hit - hit - miss - hit - hit - hit - miss
..." manifested in the first run, the pattern is going to be a series of
eight cache misses followed by long period of hits (no LED 6 light) with
eight back-by-back cache misses followed by silence again.</p>

<p><big><b>4.  Additional question for self-study</b></big></p>

<p>Read the article in Wikipedia <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order">Row-major order</a>.  Is
C programming language a row-major order language or a column-major order
language?  How the lab results would change if C uses the opposite method
for arranging multidimensional arrays in memory?</p>
