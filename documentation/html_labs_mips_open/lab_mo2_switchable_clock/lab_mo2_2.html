<p><big><b>2.  The theory of operation</b></big></p>

<p>When implemented in ASIC using 28 nm technology, MIPS microAptiv UP can
run up to 500 MHz; when implemented using 65 nm - more than 300 MHz.</p>

<p>When MIPS microAptiv UP is synthesized for FPGA together with block
memory in MIPSfpga system, the frequency is much lower - around 50-60 MHz,
both for Xilinx and Altera.  The best case for any FPGA is around 150 MHz,
with the smallest amount of block memory on some FPGAs.</p>

<p>The introductory student boards tested for MIPSfpga all have clock
generators able to generate a clock signal with the frequency of 50-100 MHz. 
This frequency can be increased or decreased using phase-locked loop (PLL). 
Unfortunately, PLL cannot be used to lower the frequency below approximately
100 KHz.  In order to lower the frequency even further, other methods have
to be used.</p>

<p>Altera has a special macro for such situation called <i>ALTCLKCTLR</i>,
but it does not work for all cases.  As a result, the switchable clock in
MIPSfpga 2.0 is implemented using a combination of a counter and a global
buffer (Xilinx macro <i>BUFG</i> and Altera macro <i>global</i>).  The
buffer is necessary, without it the synthesizer will not treat the output of
the switchable clock module as a clock and the design will not work.  It is
also necessary to have timing constraints in the constraint file for Altera
Quartus.</p>

<p>The frequency is controlled by two switches on the board.  Switches also
have to be debounced.</p>

module is instantiated in the module hierarchy for Digilent Nexys4 DDR board

<p>This lab also uses a special module to drive multi-digit seven-segment
display on the board.  A variant of such module for Digilent boards contains
the code that handles dynamic displays and a variant for Terasic boards
handles static displays.</p>
