<p><big><b>Chapter 5.  Exceptions, Interrupts, and
Initialization</b></big></p>

<p>In the MIPS architecture interrupts, traps, system calls, and everything
else that can disrupt the normal flow of execution are called exceptions and
are handled by a single mechanism.  What sort of events are they?</p>

<ul>

<li><p><i>External events</i>: Some event outside the CPU core—that is, from
some real "wire" input signal.  These are interrupts.  (Note: There are some
more obscure noninterrupt external events like bus errors reported on a
read—for now, just assume that they are a special sort of interrupt). 
Interrupts are used to direct the attention of the CPU to some external
event: an essential feature of an OS that attends to more than one different
event at a time.  Interrupts are the only exception conditions that arise
from something independent of the CPU's normal instruction stream.  Since
you can't avoid interrupts just by being careful, there have to be software
mechanisms to inhibit the effect of interrupts when necessary.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Memory translation exceptions</i>: These happen when an address
needs to be translated, but no valid translation is available to the
hardware or perhaps on a write to a write-protected page.</p>

<p>The OS must decide whether such an exception is an error or not.  If the
exception is a symptom of an application program stepping outside its
permitted address space, it will be fixed by terminating the application to
protect the rest of the system.  The more common benign memory translation
exceptions can be used to initiate operating system functions as complex as
a complete demand-paged virtual memory system or as simple as extending the
space available for a stack.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Other unusual program conditions for the kernel to fix</i>:
Notable among these are conditions resulting from floating-point
instructions, where the hardware is unable to cope with some difficult and
rare combination of operation and operands and is seeking the services of a
software emulator.  This category is fuzzy, since different kernels have
different ideas about what they're willing to fix.  An unaligned load may be
an error on one system and something to be handled in software on
another.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Program or hardware-detected errors</i>: This includes nonexistent
instructions, instructions that are illegal at user-privilege level,
coprocessor instructions executed with the appropriate SR flag disabled,
integer overflow, address alignment errors, and accesses outside
<i>kuseg</i> in user mode.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Data integrity problems</i>: Many MIPS CPUs continually check data
on the bus or data coming from the cache for a per-byte parity or for word-
wide error-correcting code.  Cache or parity errors generate an exception in
CPUs that support data checking.</p></li>

<li><p><i>System calls and traps</i>: These are instructions whose whole
purpose is to generate recognizable exceptions; they are used to build
software facilities in a secure way (system calls, conditional traps planted
by careful code, and breakpoints).</p></li>

</ul>

Starts</b></big></p>

<p>.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .</p>

<p>Here's what a MIPS CPU does when it decides to take an exception:</p>

<ol>

<li>It sets up <b>EPC</b> to point to the restart location.</li>

<li>It sets <b>SR(EXL)</b>, which forces the CPU into kernel
(high-privilege) mode and disables interrupts.</li>

<li><b>Cause</b> is set up so that software can see the reason for the
exception.  On address exceptions, <b>BadVAddr</b> is also set.  Memory
management system exceptions set up some of the MMU registers too; more
details are given in Chapter 6.</li>

<li>The CPU then starts fetching instructions from the exception entry
point, and everything else is up to software.</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>5.5 Returning from an Exception</b></big></p>

<p>The return of control to the exception victim and the change (if
required) back from kernel to a lower-privilege level must be done at the
same time ("atomically," in the jargon of computer science).  It would be a
security hole if you ran even one instruction of application code at
kernel-privilege level; on the other hand, the attempt to run a kernel
instruction with user privileges would lead to a fatal exception.</p>

<p>MIPS CPUs have an instruction, <b>eret</b>, that does the whole job; it
both clears the <b>SR(EXL)</b> bit and returns control to the address stored
in <b>EPC</b>.</p>

<p><big><b>5.8.1 Interrupt Resources in MIPS CPUs</b></big></p>

<p>MIPS CPUs have a set of eight independent (Note: Not so independent if
you're using EIC mode; see section 5.8.5.) interrupt bits in their
<b>Cause</b> register.  On most CPUs you'll find five or six of these are
signals from external logic into the CPU, while two of them are purely
software accessible.  The on-chip counter/timer (made of the <b>Count</b>
and <b>Compare</b> registers, described in section 3.3.5) will be wired to
one of them; it's sometimes possible to share the counter/timer interrupt
with an external device, but rarely a good idea to do so.</p>

<p>An active level on any input signal is sensed in each cycle and will
cause an exception if enabled.</p>

<p>The CPU's willingness to respond to an interrupt is affected by bits in
<b>SR</b>.</p>

<p>There are three relevant fields:</p>

<ul>

<li>The global interrupt enable bit <b>SR(IE)</b> must be set to 1, or no
interrupt will be serviced.</li>

<li>The <b>SR(EXL)</b> (exception level) and <b>SR(ERL)</b> (error level)
bits will inhibit interrupts if set (as one of them will be immediately
after any exception).</li>

<li>The status register also has eight individual interrupt mask bits
<b>SR(IM)</b>, one for each interrupt bit in <b>Cause</b>.  Each
<b>SR(IM)</b> bit should be set to 1 to enable the corresponding interrupt
so that programs can determine exactly which interrupts can happen and which
cannot.</li>

</ul>

<p>To discover which interrupt inputs are currently active, you look inside
the <b>Cause</b> register.  Note that these are exactly that—current
levels—and do not necessarily correspond to the signal pattern that caused
the interrupt exception in the first place.  The active input levels in
<b>Cause(IP)</b> and the masks in <b>SR(IM)</b> are helpfully aligned to the
same bit positions, in case you want to "and" them together.  The software
interrupts are at the lowest positions, and the hardware interrupts are
arranged in increasing order.</p>

<p>In architectural terms, all interrupts are equal.  (Note: That's not
quite true in vectored interrupt and "EIC mode," described in section 5.8.5,
but they're not widely used).  When an interrupt exception is taken, an
older CPU uses the "general" exception entry point—though MIPS 32/64 CPUs
and some other modern CPUs offer an optional distinct exception entry point
reserved for interrupts, which can save a few cycles.  You can select this
with the <b>Cause(IV)</b> register bit.</p>

<p>Interrupt processing proper begins after you have received an exception
and discovered from <b>Cause(ExcCode)</b> that it was a hardware interrupt. 
Consulting <b>Cause(IP)</b>, we can find which interrupt is active and thus
which device is signaling us.  Here is the usual sequence:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Consult the <b>Cause</b> register IP field and logically "and" it
with the current interrupt masks in <b>SR(IM)</b> to obtain a bit map of
active, enabled interrupt requests.  There may be more than one, any of
which would have caused the interrupt.</p></li>

<li><p>Select one active, enabled interrupt for attention.  Most OSs assign
the different inputs to fixed priorities and deal with the highest priority
first, but it is all decided by the software.</p></li>

<li><p>You need to save the old interrupt mask bits in <b>SR(IM)</b>, but
you probably already saved the whole <b>SR</b> register in the main
exception routine.</p></li>

<li><p>Change <b>SR(IM)</b> to ensure that the current interrupt and all
interrupts your software regards as being of equal or lesser priority are
inhibited.</p></li>

<li><p>If you haven't already done it in the main exception routine, save
the state (user registers, etc.) required for nested exception
processing.</p></li>

<li><p>Now change your CPU state to that appropriate to the higher-level
part of the interrupt handler, where typically some nested interrupts and
exceptions are permitted.</p>

<p>In all cases, set the global interrupt enable bit <b>SR(IE)</b> to allow
higher priority interrupts to be processed.  You'll also need to change the
CPU privilege-level field <b>SR(KSU)</b> to keep the CPU in kernel mode as
you clear exception level and, of course, clear <b>SR(EXL)</b> itself to
leave exception mode and expose the changes made in the status
register.</p></li>

<li><p>Call your interrupt routine.</p></li>

<li><p>On return you'll need to disable interrupts again so you can restore
the preinterrupt values of registers and resume execution of the interrupted
task.  To do that you'll set <b>SR(EXL)</b>.  But in practice you're likely
to do this implicitly when you restore the just-after-exception value of the
whole <b>SR</b> register, before getting into your end-of-exception
sequence.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>When making changes to <b>SR</b>, you need to be careful about changes
whose effect is delayed due to the operation of the pipeline — "CP0
hazards." See section 3.4 for more details and how to program around the
hazards.</p>
