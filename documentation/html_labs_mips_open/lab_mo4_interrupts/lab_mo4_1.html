<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>This lab shows the basic usage of interrupts in MIPS CPUs.  The lab also
demonstrates how the interrupts can offload the processor from constantly
polling I/O ports.  Such offloading increases the number of cycles available
to the processor to spend on computation and other non-I/O tasks.  The lab
example can be used as a basis for a number of follow-up exercises that
explore MIPS CPU features related to the interrupts.  Another group of
follow-up exercises can link the interrupts to software parallelism and
context switching in operating systems.  A number of recommended follow-up
exercises are listed at the end of this lab.</p>

<p>This lab can be also combined with the previous lab, <i>MIPSfpga 2.0. 
Lab YP3 - Integrating a peripheral: the light sensor example</i>, to create
a student project that demonstrates the interrupt-driven approach to
input/output, and compares this approach to polling I/O ports without using
interrupts.</p>
