<p><big><b>5.  Follow-up projects and exercises</b></big></p>

<p>The topic of interrupts is an important one, and we recommend additional
exercises to understand it fully.</p>

<p><big><b>5.1 Lab enhancements</b></big></p>

<p><b>5.1.1 Lab enhancement: Modify the system testbench to study interrupts
using Verilog simulation, without synthesizing the design</b></p>

<p>Create all the necessary scripts to show the main interrupt-related
signals on the waveform.</p>

<p><b>5.1.2 Student exercise: Improve the interrupt lab by exposing program
counter (PC) to the outside seven-segment display</b></p>

<p>Create a variant of the interrupt lab that connects the processor's
program counter (PC) to the outside multiple-digit seven-segment display. 
This connection should be muxed with the regular seven-segment display
output and should be dependent on whether some selected switch or button is
pressed.  With this setup, when the system clock is turned into slow mode,
it will be possible to observe how the processor enters interrupt service
routune.  For more details about the switchable clock see <i>MIPSfpga
Lab MO2.  Using switchable clock to observe the CPU cycle-by-cycle</i>.</p>

<p><b>5.1.3 Student investigation: Which Coprocessor 0 register bits should
be exposed to outside LEDs to observe interrupts in action in slow-clock
mode?</b></p>

<p>Find on the Imagination Technologies website <a
href="http://imgtec.com">http://imgtec.com</a> a manual called <i>MIPS&reg;
Architecture For Programmers Volume III: The MIPS32&reg; and
microMIPS32&trade; Privileged Resource Architecture</i>. Investigate which
Coprocessor 0 register fields are interesting to observe when the processor
core takes an interrupt and enters the interrupt service routine in
slow-clock mode. An example of such field is the <i>EXL</i> (<i>Exception
Level</i>) bit of the Coprocessor 0 <i>Status</i> register.</p>

<p>Modify the core and system RTL to connect these Coprocessor 0 registers
to external LEDs on FPGA board. Some fields, like <i>Status.EXL</i> do not
require changes in core RTL because the original core RTL already outputs
its value to the external pin, <i>SI_EXL</i>. Exposing such fields requires
only changes in the system RTL (<i>system_rtl/mfp_*.v</i> files) . Other
fields may require adding additional ports and connections to the core's RTL
(<i>core_rtl/m14k_*.v</i> files) as well.</p>

<p>Document your changes and create a post on MIPSfpga forum of the
Imagination Technologies website.</p>

<p><big><b>5.2 Synchronising memory access in interrupts</b></big></p>

<p><b>5.2.1 Exercise: Observe the effect of not disabling the interrupts
around critical section that updates the same variable as the interrupt
handler</b></p>

<p>Comment out the assembly commands that enable and disable interrupts
(<i>asm ("di");</i> and <i>asm ("ei")</i>) around incrementing the counter
variable <i>n</i> in <i>main</i> function inside <i>main.c</i> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
   // asm ("di");
   n ++;
   // asm ("ei");
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Build and re-run the program, using both fast and slow clocks. Can you
see the difference in system responsiveness to the interrupts? You may
observe cases when the system takes the interrupt and executes the interrupt
service routine that resets the counter. However after returning from the
interrupt, the counter appears not to be reset. Instead it continues to
increment its old value, set before entering the interrupt service routine.
Can you explain what is going on? We recommend to analyze the assembly
output of <i>gcc</i> compiler by running <i>01_compile_c_to_assembly.sh</i>
under Linux or <i>01_compile_c_to_assembly.bat</i> under Windows.</p>

<p><b>5.2.2 Exercise: Synchronize the updates of a counter variable using
<i>LL/SC</i> (Load-Linked / Store-Conditional) pair of instructions</b></p>

<p>MIPS architecture provides a way of synchronizing variable updates
without disabling interrupts, using a special pair of instructions
<i>LL/SC</i> (Load-Linked / Store-Conditional).  Create a version of
<i>main.c</i> that uses this feature of the processor instead of
<i>DI/EI</i> pair of instructions used in this lab and <i>Exercise
5.2.1</i>.  If you are not familiar with <i>LL/SC</i>, you can review the
following materials:</p>

<ul>

<li><i>MIPS32&reg; microAptiv&trade; UP Processor Core Family Software
User's Manual</i>, section 12.3, the descriptions of <i>LL</i> and <i>SC</i>
instructions. This manual is included in <i>MIPSfpga</i> package</li>

<li>Book <i>See MIPS Run, Second Edition, by Dominic Sweetman</i>, sections
<i>5.8.4 Critical Regions with Interrupts Enabled: Semaphores the MIPS
Way</i> and <i>8.5.2 Load-Linked / Store-Conditional</i>.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can implement this exercise using either a function written in
assembly and called from <i>main</i>, or, alternatively, using <i>asm</i>
construct in C with parameters, as described in online GCC documentation (<a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs</a>),
see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html">6.45.2
Extended Asm - Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</a></p>

<p><b>5.2.3 Investigation: Why do we need <i>volatile</i> qualifier for the
counter variable?</b></p>

<p>Review the code of <i>main.c</i>. Why do we need counter variable
<i>n</i> to be declared with <i>volatile</i> qualifier? How does the absence
of this qualifier change the result of program execution? Try to run the
program without <i>volatile</i> with different levels of compiler
optimizations. Is there any change in behavior? Review the code produced by
<i>gcc</i> compiler with different <i>-O</i> settings.</p>

<p><big><b>5.3 Timer interrupts</b></big></p>

<p><b>5.3.1 Student project: Timer interrupt lab using <i>Count/Compare</i>
pair of Coprocessor 0 registers present inside <i>MIPS microAptiv UP</i>
core</b></p>

<p>The timer interrupt is a special kind of hardware interrupt that occurs
regularly, with a set frequency, usually in kilohertz range. Such interrupts
are used to measure time intervals and to implement software multitasking,
including parallel task execution in operating systems.</p>

<p>Read both hardware and software documentation about an embedded timer
interrupt used in MIPS cores in conjunction with the <i>Count/Compare</i>
pair of Coprocessor 0 registers. Is this feature present in MIPSfpga? If
yes, implement a lab that uses this feature. This lab may for example
measure time between pressing some button, or do some computation while the
interrupt service routine polls some input.</p>

<p><b>5.3.2 Student project: Timer interrupt lab using a custom timer module
implemented outside <i>MIPS microAptiv UP</i> core</b></p>

<p>Create an alternative implementation of the timer interrupt lab (Exercise
5.3.1), without using the timer interrupt already implemented in <i>MIPS
microAptiv UP</i> core.  In order to create such implementation, write a
custom timer interrupt-generating module in Verilog.  Then connect it to one
of hardware interrupt pins, bits of <i>SI_Int</i> external signal.</p>

<p><b>5.3.3 Student project: Programmable timer interrupt lab using a custom
timer module implemented outside <i>MIPS microAptiv UP</i> core</b></p>

<p>Extend the student project 5.3.2 by interfacing the timer
interrupt-generating module not only to system clock, reset and
<i>SI_Int</i> signal, but also to the system's <i>AHB-Lite</i> bus.  The
goal is that the frequency of interrupts can be controlled by the software
running on MIPSfpga CPU core.  For the details of <i>AHB-Lite</i>
interfacing, see <i>Lab MO3 - Integrating a peripheral: light sensor
example</i>.</p>

<p><b>5.3.4 Student project: A variant of programmable timer interrupt lab
that uses multiple counters and interrupt pins</b></p>

<p>Create a version of the student project 5.3.3 that uses multiple counters
to generate hardware interrupts with different frequences on different
hardware pins (bits of the signal <i>SI_Int</i>).</p>

<p><b>5.3.5 Medium-to-advanced student project: Create a lab demonstrating
the multitasking / context switching</b></p>

<p>An important application of timer interrupts is to facilitate a variant
of parallel programming called task switching, or context switching. 
Context switching is widely used in operating systems, from relatively
simple, like FreeRTOS, to complicated, like Linux.</p>

<p>The idea of context switching is to periodically switch between different
threads of execution, that are also sometimes called processes or tasks. 
The "context" is a reference to a set of information associated with the
task, including program counter (PC) and general-purpose registers (GPR). 
The switch happens inside the timer interrupt service routine that saves the
current context in some memory structure (called in some systems Process
Control Block - PCB), then restores the context of a different process from
another PCB and exits the timer interrupt into the new thread of
execution.</p>

<p>Create a lab that switches between two different C functions, running in
parallel.  You don't need to use any operating system to do this.  Just save
and restore all the necessary registers inside the timer interrupt service
routine, and maintain an illusion of parallel execution of two C programs
for the end-user.  The end-user would observe the outputs from two programs
on LEDs or other output devices.</p>

<p><b>5.3.6 Advanced student project: Port some open-source RTOS, like
FreeRTOS, to MIPSfpga</b></p>

<p>FreeRTOS is a popular real-time operating system, used as an example RTOS
in the course <i>Connected MCU</i> created by Dr.Alexander Dean of North
Carolina State University.  The <i>Connected MCU</i> course demonstrates
FreeRTOS on Microchip PIC32MZ microcontroller that uses a processor core
common with MIPSfpga.  However PIC32MZ uses External Interrupt Controller
which is absent in the default MIPSfpga system which uses Interrupt
Compatibility Mode.  Porting FreeRTOS on MIPSfpga should be an appropriate
project for a graduate student of embedded programming or computer
architecture.</p>

<p><b>5.3.7 Medium-to-advanced student project: Create a lab demonstrating
switching from the user mode to the kernel mode when entering the interrupt
service routine</b></p>

<p>Processor mode is one of the most important concepts in computer science,
particularly in the operating system design.  Different CPUs have somewhat
different modes with different names: user, kernel, priviledged, superuser
and others.  MIPS32 architecture supports user mode, kernel mode and
supervisor mode.  According to <i>See MIPS Run, Second Edition, by Dominic
Sweetman</i> the supervisor mode in MIPS is a historical accident, a feature
that was added by a customer request, but was practially never used in a
real system.  So only the user and kernel modes are really used.</p>

<p>In the latest releases of MIPS32 architecture there are some additional
modes: root mode and guest mode.  These modes are related to
hardware-assisted CPU virtualization, which should not to be confused with
the virtual memory feature.  The virtual memory is present even in CPU cores
without hardware-assisted virtualization, including MIPS microAptiv UP core
used in MIPSfpga.  However the hardware-assisted virtualization is not
present in MIPSfpga, so we are not concern about root and guest modes
here.</p>

<p>The processor in kernel mode has complete access to all its architecture
resources, it can execute all instructions, access all memory locations and
all system Coprocessor 0 registers.  This mode is used to run operating
system and device drivers.</p>

<p>The processor in user mode can execute only a subset of instructions, has
no access to system coprocessor registers, and controlled access to memory
locations.  This mode is used to run application programs that may be less
reliable than the operating system.</p>

<p>When an interrupt or, in general, an exception occures, a processor
switches its mode from user to kernel and jumps to an exception handler, a
piece of code that handles the exception.  When process the exception, the
operating system performs the necessary actions.  Examples of such
actions:</p>

<ul>

<li>If the user code attempted to access a location in memory it should not
acess, the operating system can terminate the user code, keeping the memory
of the rest of the system (both OS and other application's memory) in
order.</li>

<li>If the exception is caused by the system timer interrupt, the interrupt
service routine can switch the task/process context and return from the
exception into another user task/process.</li>

<li>If the interrupt came from an input-output device, the interrupt service
routine can perform some action related to access to memory-mapped
input-output registers.  An example of such action is getting a byte
transmitted by SPI protocol and putting it into a buffer that can be later
accessed by the application code.</li>

<li>There are also special user-mode instructions that cause the intentional
exeptions, requesting the system to perform some action in kernel mode.  In
MIPS such instruction is called <i>syscall.</i></li>

<li>Finally, an exception can be caused by an illegal instruction or an
instruction that is not permitted in user mode.  The exception handler can
try to emulate the instruction instead of terminating the user code.</li>

</ul>

<p>Create a lab using MIPSfpga that demonstrates how the processor entering
the user mode.  This lab can expose <i>KSU</i> ("kernel/supervisor/user")
field of Coprocessor 0 <i>Status</i> register by connecting it to the LEDs
on FPGA board and running the system using slow 0.75 Hz or 12.5 Hz clock.</p>

<p>The main challenge in creating this lab is the need to modify the boot
code of the software example.  The current boot code exists the reset into
kernel mode, this should be changed into user mode.  The current boot code
also does not initialize virtual address mapping for the user mode.  See the
documentation on translation lookaside buffer (TLB) and memory-management
unit and modify the boot code to support the new lab.</p>

<p><big><b>5.4 Special kinds of interrupts, interrupt features and
interrupt-like exceptions</b></big></p>

<p><b>5.4.1 Student project and investigation: Non-maskable-interrupt (NMI)
lab</b></p>

<p>Study the information about non-maskable-interrupts (NMI) in
<i>MIPS32&reg; microAptiv&trade; UP Processor Core Family Software User's
Manual</i> and <i>MIPS32&reg; microAptiv&trade; UP Integrator's Guide</i>,
included in <i>MIPSfpga</i> package.</p>

<p>Create a lab that demonstrates NMI interrupts.  Investigate using the
internet the history of NMI in different computers.  Why was this feature
necessary in the past?  How useful is this feature for the modern
applications?</p>

<p><b>5.4.2 Investigation: Evaluate the usefulness and applications of
Vectored Interrupt (VI) mode in MIPS architecture</b></p>

<p>MIPS microAptiv UP core, used in MIPSfpga, supports three interrupt
modes: Interrupt Compatibility mode, Vectored Interrupt (VI) mode, and
External Interrupt Controller (EIC) mode.  So far, the lab and exercises
were using the Interrupt Compatibility mode.  An alternative Vectored
Interrupt (VI) mode adds the ability to prioritize and vector interrupts to
a handler dedicated to that interrupt.  Vectored Interrupt mode also allows
assigning a GPR (General Purpose Register) shadow set for use during
interrupt processing.</p>

<p>Study the documentation and create a lab demonstrating interrupts in
Vectored Interrupt mode.  How many clock cycles does this mode save when an
interrupt is taken?  When does it make sense to use this mode?  Consider
very low-power / low-frequency applications, interrupt response time, usage
of shadow GPR registers (not present in MIPSfpga).</p>

<p>Which interrupt mode is used in Linux?  Can you offer an explanation
why?</p>

<p><b>5.4.3 Investigation: The purpose of <i>IV</i> bit of <i>Cause</i>
Coprocessor 0 register</b></p>

<p>Read about <i>IV</i> bit of <i>Cause</i> Coprocessor 0 register.  Why
would anybody need such interrupt option?  What problem is solved by this
option?  Propose possible answers.</p>

<p><b>5.4.4 Investigation: The purpose of <i>EBase</i> Coprocessor 0
register</b></p>

<p>Read about <i>EBase</i> Coprocessor 0 register and try to explain its
usefulness.  It is only for multiprocessor systems?  How would you use it in
a single-processor system?</p>

<p><b>5.4.5 Advanced student project: Building External Interrupt Controller
(EIC)</b></p>

<p>The External Interrupt Controller (EIC) mode is another interrupt mode,
supported by MIPS microAptiv UP core used in MIPSfpga. EIC mode redefines
the way interrupts are handled to provide full support for an external
interrupt controller that handles prioritization and vectoring of
interrupts. EIC mode is used in MIPS-based microcontrollers from Microchip
Technology, including some microcontrollers from the Microchip PIC32MZ
family that are built around MIPS microAptiv UP core, the same core used in
MIPSfpga.</p>

<p>The functionality of External Interrupt Controller created by Microchip
is described in Microchip software documentation, the courses taught by
Microchip during Microchip Master Conference, as well as in Imagination,
Microchip and Digilent-sponsored course <i>Connected MCU</i> created by Dr.
Alexander Dean of North Carolina State University.</p>

<p>MIPSfpga allows you to create an alternative External Interrupt
Controller, with its own interrupt scheduling and prioritization, and
compare your solution to the solution from Microchip Technology. This is a
significant research project that can be combined with studies on Real-Time
Operating Systems (RTOS).</p>

<p><b>5.4.6 Student project: Create a lab demonstrating imprecise Bus Error
exception</b></p>

<p>All interrupts are exceptions triggered by changes in external signals,
but not all exceptions triggered by changes in external signals are in fact
interrupts.  There is an exception called Bus Error, which is triggered by a
specific AHB-Lite bus response.  This exception is also remarkable because
it is not always precise, i.e.  it may occur with <i>EPC</i> pointing to a
different instruction.</p>

<p>Read about imprecise exceptions and bus errors in documentation and
create a lab that demonstrates this feature.  The useful chapters to read
are:</p>

<ul>

<li><i>MIPS32&reg; microAptiv&trade; UP Integrator's Guide</i>, <i>Table 2.3
Signal Descriptions for m14k_cpu Level</i>, the description of <i>HRESP</i>
signal: <i>"The transfer response.  When LOW, the HRESP signal indicates
that the transfer status is OKAY.  When HIGH, the HRESP signal indicates
that the transfer status is ERROR."</i>.  This manual is included in
<i>MIPSfpga</i> package.</li>

<li><i>MIPS32&reg; microAptiv&trade; UP Processor Core Family Software
User's Manual</i>, section <i>5.8.15 Bus Error Exception - Instruction Fetch
or Data Access</i>.  Notice the statement <i>"Bus errors taken on the
requested (critical) word of an instruction fetch or data load are precise. 
Other bus errors, such as stores or non-critical words of a burst read, can
be imprecise."</i> This manual is included in <i>MIPSfpga</i> package.</li>

microarchitecture</b></big></p>

<p><b>5.5.1 Advanced student project: Create a lab demonstrating the effect
of interrupts on processor pipelining</b></p>

<p>Create all the necessary scripts to show the main interrupt-related
signals on the waveform during the simulation in Verilog simulator.  Show on
the waveform how an interrupt flushes the processor pipeline.  Which stage
of the pipeline is used to take a pending interrupt?</p>

<p>Connect the pipeline control signals to external LEDs on FPGA board and
demonstrate how an interrupt flushes the processor pipeline from the
instructions which are not going to graduate because of the interrupt.</p>

review <i>MIPSfpga.  Lab MO6 - The first glance into pipelining</i>.</p>

<p><big><b>5.6 Reimplement the light sensor lab making it
interrupt-driven</b></big></p>

<p>After going through this lab, go back to the light sensor lab <i>MIPSfpga
2.0.  Lab MO3 - Integrating a peripheral: the light sensor example</i>) and
re-implement it using interrupt-driven approach.  Modify the light sensor
interfacing module so it issues an interrupt when the measured value
changes.  Connect the interrupt pin to <i>SI_Int</i> signal of MIPS
microAptive UP core.  Measure the system performance improvement that comes
from offloading input-output to the interrupt service routine.</p>
