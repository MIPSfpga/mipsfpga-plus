<p><big><b>3. Lab steps</b></big></p>

<p>This section outlines the sequence of steps, necessary to complete the
lab.  Almost all generic steps in this lab are the same as in <i>MIPSfpga
2.0 Lab YP1.  Using MIPSfpga with Serial Loader Flow that does not require
BusBlaster board and OpenOCD software</i>.  Such generic steps are not
described in this section.  Only the steps different from <i>Lab YP1</i> are
explained in details.</p>

<p><big><b>3.1. Briefly review the reference materials</b></big></p>

<p>Look into <i>Appendix A.  A list of recommended materials to review
before and during the interrupt lab</i>.  Briefly review the listed
materials to get understanding where to look for the reference information
during the lab.</p>

<p><big><b>3.2.  Review the information about interrupt-related hardware
signals</b></big></p>

<p>Review <i>MIPS32&reg; microAptiv&trade; UP Integrator's Guide</i>,
<i>Chapter 4: Interrupt Interface</i>.  This manual is included in
<i>MIPSfpga</i> package.  The most important information is the description
of interrupt pin signal <i>SI_Int</i> used in the lab.  In the course of the
lab this multi-bit signal is connected to the buttons on FPGA board.  This
allows triggering different interrupt by pressing the corresonding
buttons.</p>


<p><big><b>3.3. Setup the hardware configuration parameters</b></big></p>

<p>Modify the configuration parameters in the file
<i>system_rtl/mfp_ahb_lite_matrix_config.vh</i> as follows:</p>

<p><big><b>3.4. Review the lab-specific hardware modifications</b></big></p>

<p>Review the following fragment of <i>system_rtl/mfp_system.v</i>:</p>

<p><big><b>3.5.  Connect the board to the computer</b></big></p>

<p>For <i>Digilent</i> boards, such as <i>Nexys4</i>, <i>Nexys4 DDR</i> or
<i>Basys3</i>, this step is obvious.  For <i>Altera/Terasic</i> boards some
additional steps required:</p>

<ol>

<li>Connect USB-to-UART connector to FPGA board.  Either <i>FT232RL</i> or
<i>PL2303TA</i> that you can by from AliExpress or Radio Shack will do the
job.  <i>TX</i> output from the connector (green wire on <i>PL2303TA</i>)
should go to pin 3 from right bottom on Terasic DE0, DE0-CV, DE1, DE2-115
(right top on DE0-Nano) and <i>GND</i> output (black wire on
<i>PL2303TA</i>) should be connected to pin 6 from right bottom on Terasic
DE0, DE0-CV, DE1, DE2-115 (right top on DE0-Nano).  Please consult photo
picture in <i>Lab YP1</i> to avoid short-circuit or other connection
problems.</li>

<li>For <i>FT232RL</i> connector: make sure to set 3.3V/5V jumper on
<i>FT232RL</i> part to 3.3V.</li>

<li>For the boards that require external power in addition to the power that
comes from USB, connect the power supply.  The boards that require the extra
power supply include <i>Terasic DE2-115</i>.</li>

<li>Connect FPGA board to the computer using main connection cable provided
by the board manufacturers.  Make sure to put USB cable to the right jack
when ambiguity exists (such as in <i>Terasic DE2-115</i> board).</li>

<li>Make sure to power the FPGA board (turn on the power switch) before
connecting the UART cable from USB-to-UART connector to the computer. 
Failing to do so may result in electric damage to the board.</li>

<li>Connect USB-to-UART connector to FPGA board.</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>3.6.  Run the synthesis and configure the FPGA with the
synthesized MIPSfpga system</b></big></p>

<p>This step is identical to the synthesis step in <i>Lab YP1</i></p>

<p><big><b>3.7.  Go to the lab directory and clean it up</b></big></p>

<p>Under Windows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
cd programs\04_interrupts
00_clean_all.bat
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Under Linux:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
cd programs/04_interrupts
./00_clean_all.sh
</pre></blockquote>

<p><big><b>3.8.  Review the portion of the lab program code that does not
use interrupts</b></big></p>

<p>The <i>main()</i> function is located in file
<i>programs/04_interrupts/main.c</i>.  This function is executed after the
reset and running the boot sequence.  The main function in this lab simply
runs a counter and outputs its value on a multi-digit seven-segment display
on FPGA board.</p>

<p>The output value is constructed from both high and low bits of the
counter.  This allows the student to observe the digits on the display
changing when running the synthesized system with either fast clock (50 MHz)
and ultra-slow clock (0.75 Hz or 12.5 Hz).  For more details about the
switchable clock see <i>MIPSfpga 2.0 Lab YP2.  Using switchable clock to
observe the CPU cycle-by-cycle</i>.</p>

<p>Depending on the position of a switch 2, the program can either run with
or without interrupts.  In both cases it resets the counter to predefined
values when either button 0 or button 1 is pressed.</p>

<p>Note that on some FPGA boards button 0 is used as system reset.  For such
boards you can either do the whole lab only using button 1 or resynthesize
the system, connecting reset to a button or a switch other than button
0.</p>

<p><big><b>3.9.  Prepare the first software run</b></big></p>

<p>Following the procedure described in <i>Lab YP1</i>, compile and link the
program, generate Motorola S-Record file and upload this file into the
memory of the synthesized MIPSfpga-based system on the board.</p>

<p>Under Windows:</p>

<ol>

<li>cd programs\04_interrupts</li>

<li>run 02_compile_and_link.bat</li>

<li>run 08_generate_motorola_s_record_file.bat</li>

<li>run 11_check_which_com_port_is_used.bat</li>

<li>edit 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.bat based on the result from the
previous step - set the working port in "set a=" assignment.</li>

<li>Make sure the switches 0 and 1 on FPGA board are turned off and switch 2
is turned on.  Switches 0 and 1 control the speed of the clock, while switch
2 determines whether the program uses interrupts (switch 2 is off) or does
not use interrupts (switch 2 is on).  See <i>3.8.  Review the lab program
code</i>.  If the switches 0 and 1 are not off, the loading through UART is
not going to work.</li>

<li>run 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.bat</li>

</ol>

<p>Under Linux:</p>

<p>If uploading program to the board first time during the current Linux
session, add the current user to <i>dialout</i> Linux group. Enter the
<i>root</i> password when prompted:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sudo adduser $USER dialout
su - $USER
</pre></blockquote>

<p>After that:</p>

<ol>

<li>cd programs/04_interrupts</li>

<li>run ./02_compile_and_link.sh</li>

<li>run ./08_generate_motorola_s_record_file.sh</li>

<li>run ./11_check_which_com_port_is_used.sh</li>

<li>edit ./12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.sh based on the result from the
previous step - set the working port in "set a=" assignment</li>

<li>Make sure the switches 0 and 1 on FPGA board are turned off and switch 2
is turned on.  Switches 0 and 1 control the speed of the clock, while switch
2 determines whether the program uses interrupts (switch 2 is off) or does
not use interrupts (switch 2 is on).  See <i>3.8.  Review the lab program
code</i>.  If the switches 0 and 1 are not off, the loading through UART is
not going to work.</li>

<li>./run 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.sh</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>3.10. The first run</b></big></p>

<ol>

<li>Set the switches 0 and 1 on FPGA board to off position and switch 2 to
on position. Make sure the switches 0 and 1 are off, otherwise the boot
sequence (a sequence of processor instructions before <i>main</i> function)
will take too long, since these switches control the clock frequency.</li>

<li><p>Reset the processor.  The reset buttons for each board are listed
in the table below:</p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0 rules=all>
<tr>
<th>Board</th>
<th>Reset button</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>Digilent Basys3</td><td>Up</td></tr>
<tr><td>Digilent Nexys4</td><td>Dedicated CPU Reset</td></tr>
<tr><td>Digilent Nexys4 DDR</td><td>Dedicated CPU Reset</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE0</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE0-CV</td><td>Dedicated reset button</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE0-Nano</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE1</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE2-115</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Terasic DE10-Lite</td><td>Button/Key 0</td></tr>
</table>

</li>

<li>Notice the output on seven-segment display.  Press button 1, observe how
it resets the counter value.</li>

<li>Turn the switch 1 on.  This will switch the system clock from 25 MHz to
12.5 Hz / beats per second.  You should see LED 7 start blinking, it is
connected straight to the system clock.  Notice the speed of counting.</li>

<li>Press button 1, observe how it resets the counter value.</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>3.12.  Review the material that explains the <i>interrupt</i>
function attribute</b></big></p>

<p>Use the following internet material to make sense of interrupt-specific
function attributes in the code: <i>Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

<p><big><b>3.13.  Review C macros that are used to access Coprocessor 0
registers</b></big></p>

<p>Search for <i>mips/cpu.h</i> header file in Codescape GCC compiler
package.  This file contains a set of macro definitions like
<i>mips32_getcr</i> and <i>mips32_bicsr</i> that aid in accessing
Coprocessor 0 registers.  These registers are needed to setup the
interrupts.</p>

<p><big><b>3.14.  Review <i>Status</i> and <i>Cause</i> Coprocessor 0
