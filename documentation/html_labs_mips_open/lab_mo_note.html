updated</b></big></p>

<p>This documentation is in the process of being updated to match the
latest version of the source code.  The planned updates include:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Informing the user how to use makefiles instead of short Linux
scripts, Windows batch files and GUI.  To see all available make actions
just run <i>make</i> in any board or program directory example:</p>

<p><i>make</i> in subdirectories of <i>boards</i> directory:</i></p>

<pre>
make help   - show this message
make all    - clean, create the board project and run the synthesis
make clean  - delete synth folder
make create - create the board project
make open   - open the board project
make build  - build the board project
make load   - program the FPGA board
</pre>

<p><i>make</i> in subdirectories of <i>programs</i> directory:</i></p>

<pre>
make help       - show this message
make all        - alternative for: compile program size disasm readmemh srecord
make program    - build program.elf from sources
make compile    - compile all C sources to ASM
make size       - show program size information
make disasm     - disassemble program.elf 
make readmemh   - create verilog memory init file for simulation
make srecord    - create Motorola S-record file to use it with UART loader
make clean      - delete all created files
make load       - load program into the device memory, run it and detach gdb
make debug      - load program into the device memory, wait for gdb commands
make attach     - attach to the device, wait for gdb commands
make uart       - load program into the device memory using UART loader
make modelsim   - simulate program and device using Modelsim
make icarus     - simulate program and device using Icarus Verilog
make gtkwave    - show the result of Icarus Verilog simulation in GTKWave
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>Adding support for <i>make uart UART=N</i> where <i>N</i> is USB-to-UART
device number (<i>/dev/ttyUSB0, 1, 2, ... N</i>).</p></li>

<li><p>Light Sensor in peripheral integration lab is now integrated not as an
addional GPIO (General Purpose I/O) device inside GPIO AHB-Lite slave, but
as a separate AHB-Lite slave.</p></li>

<li><p>Source code for pipeline bypass lab (<i>Lab MO6 - The first glance into
pipelining</i>) does not match the documentation. Please look inside the
code to see what it does.</p></li>

<li><p>The new CorExtend / UDI - User Defined Instructions example does not
have an instruction. Please refer to MIPS Open Day slides to figure out what
it does.</p></li>
