<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>In this lab you will review and synthesize a configuration of MIPSfpga
system that contains a peripheral - Digilent Pmod ALS, the Ambient Light
Sensor. In order to integrate a new peripheral into MIPSfpga system, you
have to go through three main steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Design a Verilog module that handles the external protocol used to
communicate to the peripheral. The protocol used in this lab is Serial
Peripheral Interface (SPI).</li>

<li>Create glue logic used to interface the above module with AHB-Lite,
on-chip bus fabric, used in MIPSfpga system.</li>

<li>Write software support that allows the application program running on
MIPS microAptiv UP core inside MIPSfpga system to drive the peripheral using
the corresponding memory-mapped input/output registers.</li>

</ol>

<p>By going through this lab you will understand the fundamental difference
between on-chip buses (AHB, AXI, OCP) and inter-chip buses (SPI, UART,
I<sup>2</sup>C), as well as differences between serial buses and parallel
buses. SPI bus used to communicate with the sensor is an example of a serial
bus, while AHB-Lite used in MIPSfpga SoC is an example of a parallel
bus.</p>

<p>The result of light intensity, measured in this lab, is displayed on a
multiple-digit seven-segment display. By combining a sensor, a system
controller and an output device (the display) you will construct a
practically useful gadget, a light meter.</p>

<p>This lab can be further combined with the next lab, <i> MIPSfpga 2.0. 
Lab YP4 - Introducing interrupts</i>, to demonstrate the interrupt-driven
approach to input/output used in many real embedded systems.</p>
