<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>This lab introduces switchable clock, a feature of MIPSfpga 2.0 that
enables the whole new category of student labs.  With this feature you can
first run the processor with its usual multi megahertz frequency, then
switch it to the frequence of a few clocks per second and observe how the
processor works live.  A typical usage is to connect to external LEDs the
CPU signals that control cache evictions or pipeline forwarding and observe
the LED patterns when running different sequence of code.  This usage is
demonstrated in <i>MIPSfpga 2.0.  Lab YP5 - The first glance into caches</i>
and <i>MIPSfpga 2.0.  Lab YP6 - The first glance into pipelining</i>.</p>
